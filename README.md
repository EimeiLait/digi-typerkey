# digi-typerkey


**digiTyperKey** is a retro-tech DIY project that transforms a vintage **mechanical typewriter** into a fully functional **computer keyboard**. 

## What is Typerkey?

Typerkey turns each physical key press on a typewriter into a digital keystroke, using a low-voltage wiring grid and an **Arduino Nano** to detect, encode, and transmit signals to your computer via the **PS/2 interface**.

## Features

- Detects mechanical key presses through a wire-matrix circuit
- Decoded in real time by an Arduino Nano
- Sends output as standard keyboard signals (PS/2 protocol)
- Keeps the tactile and acoustic feedback of a real typewriter

## How It Works

Each key completes a circuit between horizontal and vertical wires, producing a unique binary code. The Arduino reads this code, maps it to a character, and sends it to the host computer as if from a regular keyboard.
